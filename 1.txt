Challenge – File Copier
You are required to create a file copy program that works exactly like a windows file copy
mechanism with the functionalities described below:
• It will ask the user for the file name which needs to be copied.
• If the input file exists then it will copy that file into a new file name with exact conventions
followed by windows. (i.e. “- Copy”, “- Copy (2)” etc.)
